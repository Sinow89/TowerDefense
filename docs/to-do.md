- To a make Fieldrunners  like game. 
- Enemeys spawn outside tha map en go into the screen
- Make x*y grid
- Start with have enmey moving towards the towers and damaging them and they break after x amount of dmg.
- Have a base which is your main health, if the base "dies" then game over.
- Priority, the enemys moves towards the towers first, and then towards the base. Maybe have like a radius on tower.
